## Usage

Tailstart serves as a starting point for creating web applications or sites. It eliminates the process of setting up base configurations for project that uses TailwindCSS. It can be further customized and integrated with any frameworks according to your project's requirement. 

>Note:
Tailstart does not include bundler tools such as `webpack` or `parcel` since it is a bare-bones boilerplate designed to be adaptable with any development stack.
