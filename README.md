# Tailstart Kit
A handcrafted collection of TailwindCSS multipurpose starter kits, components and layouts.

## Usage
Tailstart starter kits serves as a boilerplate for creating web applications or sites. It eliminates the need for base configuration of web project development when using TailwindCSS. It is designed to be adaptable with any development stacks and therefore does not include any specific bundler tools such as Vite, Webpack, or Parcel.
